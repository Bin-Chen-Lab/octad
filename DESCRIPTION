Description: Open Cancer TherApeutic Discovery (OCTAD) package implies sRGES approach for the drug discovery. The essential idea is to identify drugs that reverse the gene expression signature of a disease by tamping down over-expressed genes and stimulating weakly expressed ones. The following package contains all required precomputed data for whole OCTAD pipeline computation.
